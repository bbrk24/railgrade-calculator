# Railgrade Calculator

**See the live version here: <https://bbrk24.github.io/railgrade-calculator/>**

This program provides some numbers about a train in Railgrade, so that you can know ahead of time
how a train will perform without having to build it.

I haven't looked at the code of the game; rather, I determined these numbers by measuring them
in-game. Numbers may not be completely accurate for longer trains, but they should be close enough.

Unfortunately, I have not been able to determine how acceleration is calculated for trains with more
than one type of engine.
