# Railgrade Calculator

This program provides some numbers about a train in Railgrade, so that you can know ahead of time
how a train will perform without having to build it.

I haven't looked at the code of the game; rather, I determined these numbers by measuring them
in-game. I didn't do any measurements for trains with more than six cars per engine, so numbers will
be inaccurate beyond that point. Additionally, numbers might not be completely accurate for trains
with more than two engines, but hopefully it's close enough.

Unfortunately, I have not been able to determine how acceleration is calculated for trains with more
than one type of engine.

To run the program, simply open index.html in a browser. You may have to download the file first;
GitHub's preview only shows you the code.
