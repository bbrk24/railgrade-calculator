# Railgrade Calculator

This program provides some numbers about a train in Railgrade, so that you can know ahead of time
how a train will perform without having to build it.

I haven't looked at the code of the game; rather, I determined these numbers by measuring them
in-game. Numbers may not be completely accurate for longer trains, but they should be close enough.

Unfortunately, I have not been able to determine how acceleration is calculated for trains with more
than one type of engine.

To run the program, simply open index.html in a browser. You may have to download the file first;
GitHub's preview only shows you the code.
